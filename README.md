# Quotes
## Swift app for your favorite quotes 

### Builded with SwiftUI, [SwiftData](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftdata/), [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/quotes). In this app you can add random quote from DummyJSON API or your own quotes. Also you can search through all quotes and like your favorite to see them on another screen.

### How to run project:
1. Clone this repository
2. Open directory with .xcworkspace in its name (in XCode)
3. Build application

During development, I encountered problems with the compatibility of the project on different computers, so I leave a one hundred percent solution below.

#### If something above went wrong try this:
1. Clone every .swift file from QuotesLister folder
2. Create new project
3. Init cocoapods in this project (with pod 'Alamofire')
4. Open directory with .xcworkspace in its name 
5. Paste .swift files from point 1 to your new project
6. Build application
